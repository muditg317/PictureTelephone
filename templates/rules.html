  <h1 id='secondTitle'>So, What's The Point?</h1>
  <h4 id='intro'>  Drawing with a mouse is hard.<br>Drawing with only written directions is hard, too.</h4>
  <p id='paragraph'>
    <!-- That is what inspires our game. Sometimes there's nothing more fun than silly misunderstandings. -->
    Now, imagine recreating someone's drawing, with a mouse, no eraser, and a third person's description.
    This usually leads to an end result that looks nothing like the original work, but don't worry, becuase that's
    the point of TeleDrawings. Every addition to a thread leads farther and farther away from the original, but gives
    us more fun along the way.
  <br>
  <br>
    You don't have to be able to draw in order to play, becuase the draiwngs that lead to funnier threads
    arent't necessarily the ones with better technique. What's even better is that you don't even have to know what you're
    drawing, becuase describing it is someone else's job. There are no right answers and no points, so it's not a competition.
    Just have fun and don't be worried of getting something 'wrong'.
  <br>
  <br>
    We hope you enjoy
  <br>
    -Mudit and Erica
